<h3>Report Example</h3>
This report is generated by a custom solution I developed using Parallel Stages in Jenkins scripted pipelines, significantly improving run times.

The environment consists of approximately 400 servers. Previously, the script took 20-40 minutes to execute. With the new pipeline, the average run time is reduced to 4 minutes.

Additionally, the old script had several issues, such as:

Code duplication (copy-pasting instead of using functions)
Poor error handling
Lack of text formatting
False negatives in the results
By addressing these problems and optimizing the pipeline, the new solution is both faster and more reliable.

This version highlights key information, uses bullet points for clarity, and removes unnecessary repetitions.
