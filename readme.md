<h3>Report Example</h3>
<hr>
<p>This report is generated by a custom solution I developed using <strong>Parallel Stages</strong> in Jenkins scripted pipelines, significantly improving run times.</p>

<p>The environment consists of approximately 400 servers. Previously, the script took 20-40 minutes to execute. With the new pipeline, the average run time is reduced to <strong>4 minutes</strong>.</p>

<p>Additionally, the old script had several issues, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Code duplication (copy-pasting instead of using functions)</li>
  <li>Poor error handling</li>
  <li>Lack of text formatting</li>
  <li>False negatives in the results</li>
</ul>

<p>By addressing these problems and optimizing the pipeline, the new solution is both faster and more reliable.</p>
